Using ML to solve rising CO2 levels while simultaneously using the bi-product as rocket fuel.

The Scientific Method

1. Define a question: Can machine learning predict new and innovative ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere while simultaneously creating a bi-product to be used for rocket fuel?

2. Gather information and resources (observe)

SpaceX Rocket Fuel:
-Refined liquid methane is used as a component of rocket fuel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane#Fuel)
-Liquid oxygen (LOX) is used as a component of rocket fuel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_propellant#Liquid_chemical_propellants)
-Gaseous methane and gaseous oxygen is expected to be used in the future

3. Form an explanatory hypothesis

4. Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner

5. Analyze the data

6. Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for a new hypothesis

7. Publish results

8. Retest (frequently done by other scientists)
